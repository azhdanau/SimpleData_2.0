SimpleData 2.0 is totally refactored comparing with the first version<br />
1) Use notification merges, not parent-child mechanism. It is much faster<br />
2) Simple usege of CoreData in background threads<br />
3) Add comments to all methods<br />
4) Some bugs fixed<br />
<br />
You can find examples of usage in UnitTest files.<br />
<br />
